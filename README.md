# jekyll-authors

This is a proof of concept repo demonstrating how to add authors to posts. It includes author meta in posts and profile page listing their posts.

The solution is to use Jekyll's collections feature to create a list of authors. Collections can be rendered as pages, so we use each auhtor page as a place to list their posts. Then we simply refer to the author's name in each post to cross reference them.
